# Ramblings while struggling through Haskell

## Monads

are difficult.

Use `<-` to handle IO monads and 'take' something out. Need to learn more about errors & exceptions...

## `null` Quirks

`null` is wierd. How does it fit in? Anyway `null []` evaluates to `True`. `null` is a function that checks for empty lists? `null [[]]` evaluates to `False`.
